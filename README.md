## Abstract
The stock market is highly unpredictable which makes it difficult for investors to know when to buy, sell, or hold their stock. This is particularly challenging when it comes to short term investing because stock prices tend to be more stochastic. With this project we will use data science analytics techniques to develop a system that helps investors make profitable investment decisions. Using the K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm we will identify patterns in the stock price data with which we will use to recommend investors to buy, sell, or hold their stock. Additionally we will use the association rules machine learning technique to identify relationships between stocks.

## Introduction
Successful stock market investing is difficult due to the large number of complex factors that influence investment decisions such as fluctuating stock prices, expected stock price trends, and the sheer number of available stocks to choose from. 

With this project we will attempt to create a system that helps investors with finding profitable stocks and knowing when to buy, sell, or hold them. The main focus of our project will be short time investing since these trends tend to fluctuate more and are therefore more difficult for investors to understand and analyze.

It is important to note that actually predicting the price of a stock is not within the scope of our project. The stock market is an example of a second order chaos system, meaning that it responds to predication and thus becomes more unpredictable. Rather, our intention is to provide investors with additional insight into the data they are analyzing so that they are more informed when they make the final decision. 

Many of the challenges related to investment stem of human nature, by assisting investors with an unbiased system some of these difficulties can be alleviated. For instance, common mistakes made by investors are impatience, failing to diversify, and falling for the sunk cost fallacy. A system that helps investors decide when to buy, sell, or hold their stock can be useful to an impatient user or one who has invested a significant amount into a certain stock and is holding on to their stock with the intention of at least breaking even. Additionally, by finding correlations between stocks, our system can help investors diversify their portfolios and avoid the risk inherent in placing too much value in a single stock.
